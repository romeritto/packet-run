# Packet run
Single-page app for a camp game encouraging children to run. Players physically
(by running) transmit packets from server to clients. A successfully transmitted
packet can be submitted to the app which updates the total score. The app also
accounts for *packet loss* and has a minimalistic, interactive interface
to motivate the children.

## Installation
Prerequisites are **Node** and **npm**.

Starting the *dev* version at http://localhost:3000

```
git clone https://github.com/romeritto/packet-run
cd packet-run
npm install
npm start
```
